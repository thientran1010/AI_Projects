experiments.py

A script for conducting training and testing experiments with the DQN agent
on the LunarLander-v3 environment. Includes support for dynamic hyperparameter
selection and model management.

Author: AF
Created: 06-28-2025

Description:
    - Allows user to run full training + testing experiments.
    - Interactively sets number of neurons and layers.
    - Supports overwriting previous models and cleans up temporary model files on exit.
    - Contains demo mode for quick agent evaluation.

Functions:
    - demo(): Run pre-trained agent in human-rendered environment.
    - train(): Train a new model with specified hyperparameters.
    - test(): Evaluate a trained model.
    - run_new_experiment(): Main experiment workflow with user input.
    - cleanup(): Removes the temporary model file if it exists.
